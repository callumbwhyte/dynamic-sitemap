Friendly Sitemap makes adding a dynamic `sitemap.xml` file to your Umbraco 8 website easy!

## Getting started

This package is supported on Umbraco 8.1+.

### Installation

Friendly Sitemap is available from Our Umbraco, NuGet, or as a manual download directly from GitHub.

#### Our Umbraco repository

You can find a downloadable package on the [Our Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.com/projects/website-utilities/friendly-sitemap/) site.

#### NuGet package repository

To [install from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Our.Umbraco.FriendlySitemap/), run the following command in your instance of Visual Studio.

```console
PM> Install-Package Our.Umbraco.FriendlySitemap
```

## Usage

Once installed, the sitemap will be visible on the URL `/sitemap.xml`, such as `https://www.yoursite.com/sitemap.xml`. The items displayed in the sitemap will be specific to the current domain.

If a physical `sitemap.xml` file exists in your website, the dynamically generated sitemap will be disabled.
It is possible to override the url of the sitemap.

```xml
<add key="Umbraco.Sitemap.SitemapUrl" value="xmlsitemap" />
```

It is possible to disable the sitemap via an app setting in `web.config` file:

```xml
<add key="Umbraco.Sitemap.EnableSitemap" value="false" />
```

### Controlling output

By default the sitemap will include all content items within the current site with a template assigned.

Adding a true / false (boolean) property to any doctype with the alias `sitemapExclude` makes it possible to hide specific items from the sitemap.

All of the XML Sitemap v0.9 [tag definitions](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#xmlTagDefinitions) can be modified by adding properties with specific aliases to any doctype:

| Attribute  | Property alias    |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| url        | url               |
| lastmod    | updateDate        |
| changefreq | sitemapChangeFreq |
| priority   | sitemapPriority   |

### Advanced configuration

It is possible to override the default configuration of the package using dependency injection, by registering a new instance of `SitemapConfiguration` within an `IUserComposer` class.

This is helpful for advanced configuration needs, such as defining unique settings per site in a multi-site Umbraco installation.

Here's an example:

```csharp
using Our.Umbraco.FriendlySitemap.Startup;

[ComposeAfter(typeof(SitemapComposer))]
public class CustomSitemapComposer : IUserComposer
{
    public void Compose(Composition composition)
    {
        composition.Register(factory => GetConfiguration(), Lifetime.Request);
    }

    private SitemapConfiguration GetConfiguration()
    {
        var configuration = new SitemapConfiguration
        {
            EnableSitemap = true,
            SitemapUrl = "xmlsitemap"
        };

        return configuration;
    }
}
```
